* After starting the application, you can access to the data with the following URLs:
  - "/localhost:8080/employees" it returns all employees in the db
  - "/localhost:8080/employees/{id}" it returns employee by given id
  - "/localhost:8080/" Welcome Screen

  - "/localhost:8080/employees" (POST)
  - "/localhost:8080/employees/{id}" (PUT)
  - "/localhost:8080/employees/{id}" (DELETE)
  
* If there is no employee by given id, it returns "EmployeeNotFoundException" with (404)HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).
